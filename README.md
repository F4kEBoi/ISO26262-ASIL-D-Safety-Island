## 📖 Overview

ISO26262-ASIL-D-Safety-Island provides a safety-critical architecture for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. This application implements standards required for functional safety, including ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliance. Key features include Atomic Bit-Banding, Window Watchdog (WWDG) synchronization, and Deterministic Fault Recovery. These mechanisms work together to ensure a Fault Tolerant Time Interval (FTTI) of less than 20 milliseconds.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Bare-Metal Architecture**: Runs directly on the hardware, ensuring low-level control and high performance.
- **ISO 26262 Compliance**: Meets high safety standards necessary for autonomous driving systems.
- **Atomic Bit-Banding**: Allows for safe and efficient memory access.
- **Window Watchdog Synchronization**: Monitors system health and resets it when necessary.
- **Deterministic Fault Recovery**: Ensures quick recovery from faults, maintaining safety and reliability.

## 🛠️ System Requirements

To run ISO26262-ASIL-D-Safety-Island, you’ll need:

- **Processor**: ARM Cortex-M4 or compatible.
- **Memory**: At least 256 KB RAM.
